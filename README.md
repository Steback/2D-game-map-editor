# 2D Game Map Editor

This editor is a project that I did myself, for the challenge of [Gustavo Pezzi](https://github.com/gustavopezzi), who put in his course [Fundamentals of 2D Game Engines with C++ SDL and Lua ]( https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-2d-game-engine/ ). The Editor has a lot of bugs, I don't implement many things, but it is the best I can do now, I hope that in the future I can will improve it. I do this project to learn more about Game Developmet and practice my skills.
